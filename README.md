# 🕸️ spidernet

Spidernet is a collection of searchable servers from across the world. It also monitors activity for all servers in the background.


## Getting started with a breeze 😏
* Clone the project
* Copy `config.example.yaml` and rename the new version as `config.yaml`
* Configure `config.yaml` to your needs
* Get all of the dependencies by executing `go get ./...` in your project root directory & **RUN**!

## Roadmap
* `/api` is the app entry point, and defines the app's routes
* `/handlers` contains all handlers
* `/helpers` contains helper files & functions to assist handlers
* `/storage` consists of the database client, and database schemas
* `/util` contains the app's console commands and configuration
